JS2 - JQuery Generator
Overview:
This assignment gives you an opportunity to use a little bit of JQuery.  This shouldn't take long.  


Requirements:
There must be one textbox at the top of the page
Next to the textbox should be a button that says "GO"
When the user enters a number in the box and clicks the GO button, a table should be generated below the textbox that contains a count in the first cell and the programmer's name in the second cell.  Whatever number the user enters in the box is the number of rows that should be generated.
If the user clicks GO again, the old table will be removed and a new one will be created.
There should be a button above the table that says "Shade Every Other Row".
When the user clicks the "Shade Every Other Row" button, the table rows should be alternatively shaded (white and #DDD).
There should be another button above the table that says "Show Dark Line Every 10 Rows".
When the user clicks the "Show Dark Line Every 10 Rows", the bottom border of every 10th line should become a 5px thick black line.
There should also be a "Reset Table" button which clears the formatting of the table.
